This is a list of my favorite restaurants, organized by location. Each restaurant has a category. There are no stars or anything. If I really like something, it's on the list! If I haven't been to it, or I don't like it, it's not. Partially resurrected from my personal website circa 2010.

### contributions

This is a highly subjective document, obviously, but contributions are welome! If you strongly **disagree** that a restaurant should be listed here, disagree with how it's categorized, or just want to discuss why it's here, open an Issue. If you want to **add** a restaurant, submit a Pull Request. If I've been to it and like it, we'll add it to the list. If I haven't, we'll put it in the "To Try" category. And if our preferences diverge too much that's cool too, just fork and make your own!
