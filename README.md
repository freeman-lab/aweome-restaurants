# restaurants

This is a list of my favorite restaurants, organized by location. Each restaurant has a category. There are no stars or anything. If I really like something, it's on the list! If I haven't been to it, or I don't like it, it's not. Resurrected from my personal website circa 2010.

### contributions

This is a highly subjective document, but contributions are very welome! If you strongly **disagree** that a restaurant should be lsited here, or disagree with how it's categorized, open an Issue. If you want to **add** a restaurant, submit a Pull Request. The caveats are that it needs to be a restaurant that I have (a) been to and (b) like enough to include on this list. If our preferences diverge too much, fork and make your own!
