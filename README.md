[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

> list of my favorite restaurants, organized by location, inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) lists

Every restaurant gets a category. There are no ratings. If I really like something, it's on the list! If I haven't been to it, or I don't like it, it's not. Partially resurrected from my personal website circa 2010.

### contributions

This is highly subjective, obviously, but contributions are welome! If you  **disagree** that a restaurant should be listed, open an Issue. If you want to **add** a restaurant, submit a Pull Request. I'll try to go to it, and if I like it, I'll add it to the list!
